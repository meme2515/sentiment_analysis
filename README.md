# 👨‍💼 Trump's Twitter Account

In this project I have analyzed Donald Trump's Tweets to find insights such as the upload time distribution across different devices, change in device usage over time, and VADER sentiment score of tweets containing specific words (such as nytimes and fox news). The project is divided into three distinct parts.

## 1. Data Import 🦜

## 2. Tweet Source 📱

## 3. Sentiment Score 😠😄
