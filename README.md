# 👨‍💼 Trump's Twitter Account

In this project I have analyzed Donald Trump's Tweets to find insights such as the upload time distribution across different devices, change in device usage over time, and [VADER](http://datameetsmedia.com/vader-sentiment-analysis-explained/) sentiment score of tweets containing specific words (such as nytimes and fox news). The project is divided into three distinct parts.

## 1. Data Import 🦜

## 2. Tweet Source 📱

## 3. Sentiment Score 😠😄
